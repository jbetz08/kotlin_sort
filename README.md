# Overview

I am trying to accomplish getting used to the syntax of Java/Kotlin for future android application development.

The software I wrote is a sorting algorithm called the sub-list sort

I wrote this software to focus on the syntax of Kotlin and learn it's habits

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA platform

I used Kotlin which is the app development version of Java that Google created
I also imported the java util* library

# Useful Websites

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-mutablelistof/)

# Future Work

* Fix the functionality of my sort
* understand copies and pointers
* add a 3rd option to interact()
